# X-Datascience Datacamp

*Datacamp class for master student - 4 days*

The aim of this course is to learn data science by doing. All aspects of completing a data science pipeline will be covered, from exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, parameter optimization to advanced learning algorithms. You will also need to setup your own challenge!

Grade is a mix of your performance on the data challenge offered to the class as well as the challenge you will setup.

Each you will 50% of lectures and 50% of work on the competitive challenge using the [RAMP](https://ramp.studio/) website.
